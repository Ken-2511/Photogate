# Photogate

## Background

Photogates are used to measure objects' speed or acceleration. My high school physics teacher wanted a teaching aid to demonstrate the objects' speed change. In her imagination, there are ten photogates forming a tunnel, and an object go through the photogates, and the photogates show the time of seeing the object.

## My Design Specification

Here is my design specification.

### How to detect object

I decided to use laser emitter and receiver to detect objects' movement. Whenever an opaque object goes through the photogate, the laser is blocked, and the laser receiver would push a signal to the microprocessor (Arduino nano).

### How to show the time

I installed a nixie-tube on each...

There are lower computer and upper computer programs for the "photogate" designed for my high school.
